                        <h2>Our Communities</h2>
                        <p>At MedLabs we are sensitive to the needs of a world faced with innumerable challenges.

                        <h2>Our Planet</h2>
                        <p>We depend on the natural environment for satisfying our requirements and business needs. Resources like water, energy and fuel consumed translate into wastes, and if not scientifically handled and disposed impact lives and ecosystems. Water being vital for life, is cautiously handled, saving as much of this precious resource as possible. In doing so, the water saved is made available to those who need it the most. Our initiative for reducing consumption of energy ensures lesser emissions to the environment, thereby reducing the impact of climate change to all inhabitants of this planet. As part of our efforts at minimizing waste, we use innovative processes for recycling and recovery. This helps to save virgin material from being extracted while also saving emissions from the extraction processes. The larger goal of all of these initiatives is the preservation of natural resources for our future generations.</p>
                        <h2>Our people</h2>
                        <p>We believe in enriching lives of employees by providing growth opportunities, fair employment conditions and a safe & healthy work environment. Through our activities we strive to create a healthier, knowledgeable and happier world by enriching lives of all our stakeholders and community at large</p>

                        <p>At MedLabs, we believe that Research and Development is at the core of everything we do. It is our pursuit to enrich lives globally by meeting the unmet medical needs. Our continuous efforts have resulted in a strong pipeline of specialty products and novel molecules focused in three key therapeutic areas of dermatology, oncology and respiratory. We are working on an exciting pipeline of specialty products primarily in the respiratory and dermatology categories. Presently we have several molecules, both New Chemical Entities (NCEs) and New Biological Entities (NBEs), in letious stages of pre-clinical and clinical development. MedLabs has made its mark in the discovery of novel molecular entities by out-licensing its own molecules to large multinationals. We have successfully out-licensed 7 molecules to 5 companies and have received a total of USD 217 million in up-front and milestone payments cumulatively.</p>

                        <p> MedLabs is the only company from emerging markets to execute multiple deals on novel molecules.</p>
                        <p>Our endeavor is catalyzed by a strong research infrastructure and an in-house team of experts. Our R&D center in Navi Mumbai, India is focused on discovery of New Chemical Entities and the Switzerland R&D center is focused on discovery and development of New Biological Entities. We have also developed our own proprietary platform for production of bispecific antibodies called BEATÂ® at our Switzerland R&D Center. Our global R&D capabilities are also reflected by the fact that we have approved clinical trial sites in over 20 countries.</p>
